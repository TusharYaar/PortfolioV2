    "Mockback is a simple application to make backend apis and monitor those routes. It allows you to define custom routes and the response it would give when called. You can make routes which few clicks and use it anywhere. One nifty feature is, you could also define the type of data, say firstname and application will provide you with a different firstname anytime you call. You could also require authorization and provide the ids in the header which will be authorized. All in all its a simple application to allow use to develop your front end while your backend catches up requests.",
